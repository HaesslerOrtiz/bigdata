In this exercise you should choose one of the three following datasets, and
then perform Exploratory Data Analysis, similarly as we made it before.
Your goal is to prepare a technical mini-report with your findings. Your
mini report must contain the following information:

- Brief description of the data
- Results: visual (and numerical if needed) information that summarises
  the performed analysis
- Relevant snippets of code used to obtain the results
